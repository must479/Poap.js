# Queries Utils

When building Compass queries, it might be useful to have some little utilities to not repeat the
same code many times. There two types of utils for queries, building orders and building filters.

## Order By

When you have a query that accepts an `$orderBy` variable that let you input the field name and the
sort order, for example:

```graphql
query MyDrops(
  $orderBy: [drops_order_by!]
) {
  drops(
    order_by: $orderBy
    where: {
      drop_id: { _in: [14] }
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

And an enum that let you choose what fields you want to order by:

```typescript
enum MyDropSortFields {
  Id = 'id',
  Name = 'name',
}
```

You can then build the variable `$orderBy` with `createOrderBy`:

```typescript
import { Order, OrderByVariables, createOrderBy } from '@poap-xyz/utils';

const variables: OrderByVariables = {
  orderBy: createOrderBy<MyDropSortFields>(MyDropSortFields.Name, Order.ASC),
};
```

## Filters

There are many filters with different types and for different results, normally you will have a
query that accepts a `$where` variable and then you can construct the variables with the use of the
filters utils.

For example:

```typescript
import {
  FilterVariables,
  createBoolFilter,
  createLikeFilter,
  createBetweenFilter,
} from '@poap-xyz/utils';

const variables: FilterVariables = {
  where: {
    ...createBoolFilter('private', true),
    ...createLikeFilter('name', 'My Awesome POAP'),
    ...createBetweenFilter('created_date', '2023-12-23', '2024-02-28'),
  },
};
```

The possible filters to create are:

- `createLikeFilter`: searchs for the value to be included case-unsensitive in the field.
- `createEqFilter`: match exact field value.
- `createNeqFilter`: match not equal field value.
- `createBoolFilter`: when the value is true or false.
- `createAddressFilter`: given the address match it case-unsensitive.
- `createNotNullAddressFilter`: excludes the zero and/or dead addresses.
- `createInFilter`: if the field is contained in any of the given values.
- `createNinFilter`: not contained in the given values.
- `createBetweenFilter`: from and to values, mostly used for dates.
