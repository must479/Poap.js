**Overview**

POAP is a public good, built on behalf of every human, to empower the individual with a reliable system for preserving memories and recognizing contributions to the collective happiness and well-being of the people around them.

Developers are the unsung heroes behind this public good. While POAP Inc builds the tech, developers build the vibrant ecosystem of applications that connect communities and create new avenues for curated participation.

POAP is curated ecosystem for the preservation of memories. The platform provides the infrastructure for issuers to mint and distribute digital collectables that mark lifeâ€™s most memorable moments.

The POAP platform offers numerous functionalities exposed through an API. Everyone is free to use POAP's API to obtain information regarding POAPs minted, drops created, etc. 

Additionally, you can use the API to create your applications on top of POAP by automating POAP distributions. For this, you will need API authorization tokens.
