## PoapProperties Interface

The `PoapProperties` interface defines the shape of the object required by the constructor of the `POAP` class.

```typescript
interface PoapProperties {
  id: number;
  collectorAddress: string;
  transferCount: number;
  mintedOn: Date;
  dropId: number;
  imageUrl: string;
  city: string;
  country: string;
  description: string;
  startDate: Date;
  name: string;
  endDate: Date;
}
```

Each property in the `PoapProperties` interface corresponds to a property in the `POAP` class, and their descriptions are as mentioned above in the Properties section.
